  <h2 id="toc-0">Fire</h2>
  <p>If your clothes catch on fire:</p>
  <p>
    Stop what you're doing.
    <br />Drop to the ground and cover your face if you can. <br />
    Roll over and over or back and forth until the flames go out. Running will only make the fire burn faster.
    <br />Once the flames are out, cool the burned skin with water for three to five minutes. Call for medical attention.<br />
  </p>

  <p>Tips for staying safe:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If there is a fire extinguisher in the vicinity, follow the instructions shown to operate it safely</li>
    <li>Remember to GET OUT, STAY OUT and CALL 9-9-9 or your local emergency phone number</li>
    <li>Alert people of the fire. Always use the stairs instead of an elevator. Leave your belongings where they are and save yourself</li>
    <li>Never open doors that are warm to the touch. If handles are warm or smoke blocks your primary escape, use a second exit</li>
    <li>If you must escape through smoke, get low and go under the smoke to your exit. Close doors behind you</li>
    <li>
      If smoke, heat or flames block your exit routes, stay in the room with doors closed. Place a wet towel under the door and call the
      fire department or 9-9-9. Open a window and wave a brightly colored cloth or flashlight to signal for help
    </li>
    <li>
      Once you are outside, go to your meeting place and then send one person to call the fire department. If you cannot get to your meeting
      place, follow your family emergency communication plan
    </li>
  </ul>

  <br />

  <h2 id="toc-1">Traffic Accident</h2>
  <p>What to do when encountering a traffic accident:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure the incident area is safe for yourself and others</li>
    <li>Park safely and well away from the incident. Make sure you turn on your hazard lights</li>
    <li>Make vehicles safe by switching off the ignition of all damaged and surrounding cars and if you can, disconnect the battery</li>
    <li>Be alert for physical dangers such as traffic and make sure no one smokes near the incident</li>
    <li>
      On large diesel vehicles this is marked on the outside. <br />Make vehicles stable. Apply the handbrake, put them in gear or put a
      block in front of the wheels if the vehicle is upright.<br />
      If it is on it's side, try to stop it rolling over further, but do not attempt to move it
    </li>
    <li>Call the emergency services to report damaged power lines, spilt fuel or vehicles carrying hazardous substances</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Assessing the casualties:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Call 999 or 112 straight away</li>
    <li>
      Assess the casualties quickly by doing the primary survey <br />1. Check for Danger.<br />
      2. Check for a Response.
      <br />3. Open Airway.<br />
      4. Check Breathing.
      <br />5. Check Circulation<br />
    </li>
    <li>
      Treat anyone with life threatening injuries first - Assume that anyone involved in the accident may have neck or spinal injuries
    </li>
    <li>Treat the casualties in the position you find them if possible and make sure you support their head and neck at all times</li>
    <li>
      Make sure you search the surrounding area so that casualties who are not in the immediate incident area are found and treated - ask
      others to do this if they are available
    </li>
    <li>5. If anyone is trapped inside or under a vehicle, the fire service will need to help them</li>
    <li>Monitor the casualties and record their breathing, pulse and level of response</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="toc-6">Acts of Terrorism</h2>
  <p>
    If you witness an act of terrorism either at home or abroad there are three basic steps that you should follow: <br />RUN - to a place
    of safety. This is better than trying to surrender or negotiate.<br />
    HIDE - it is better to hide than confront. Barricade yourself in, turn your phone to silent and use only when it safe to do so.
    <br />TELL - Alert police. Make sure you know the local emergency number - in the UK it’s 999, for EU countries it’s 112.<br />
  </p>

  <p>If an event of Terrorism Occurs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remain calm and be patient</li>
    <li>Follow the advice of local emergency officials</li>
    <li>Listen to your radio or television for news and instructions</li>
    <li>If the event occurs near you, check for injuries. Give first aid and get help for seriously injured people</li>
    <li>
      If the event occurs near your home while you are there, check for damage using a flashlight. Do not light matches or candles or turn
      on electrical switches. Check for fires, fire hazards and other household hazards. Sniff for gas leaks, starting at the water heater.
      If you smell gas or suspect a leak, turn off the main gas valve, open windows, and get everyone outside quickly
    </li>
    <li>Shut off any other damaged utilities</li>
    <li>Confine or secure your pets</li>
    <li>Call your family contact—do not use the telephone again unless it is a life-threatening emergency</li>
  </ul>
