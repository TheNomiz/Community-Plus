<h4><strong>Approach To Accessibility</strong></h4>
<p>
  At Community Plus, we understand that producing an inclusive online experience is crucial. For that reason, we are dedicated to making our
  website accessible to everyone. Accessibility is essential for an application because it ensures that everyone, regardless of their
  abilities, can access and use the application, especially one that is focussed on safety and community. Therefore, we are always looking
  for ways to improve this part of our service for people with disabilites and limitations such as visual, hearing, or other impairments,
  who might otherwise not be able to use it. We appreciate any suggestions related to accessibility through our email address which can be
  found on the Privacy Policy page. Currently, we have implemented multiple features to ensure that our website is user-friendly and easy to
  navigate.
</p>
<h5>Darkmode</h5>
<p>
  One of the most notable features we offer is the dark mode option. Users who prefer low-light conditions or who have visual impairments
  can use this mode. It makes it simpler for users to read text and lowers the amount of blue light generated by the screen, which can
  strain the user's eyes. Additionally, the dark mode is accessible on the entire website, guaranteeing a constant user experience. This
  mode can be selected through the User Profile page.
</p>
<h5>Font Size</h5>
<p>
  We have ensured that the font size can be adjusted to make it smaller or larger, providing a comfortable and personalised experience for
  each user who may want to use this feature for preference or as a result of visual impairment. This feature can also be used through the
  User Profile page
</p>
<h5>Resize Windows</h5>
<p>
  We have made a concious effort to develop the website in a way that is easy to navigate and user-friendly. This includes the ability to
  resize windows, making it easier for users to customize their user experience according to preference. This feature ensures that users can
  comfortably navigate our website depending on their screen size.
</p>
<h5>Clear-Cut Headings</h5>
<p>
  Understanding the significance of easy to read fonts, legible font size, and apparent headings, especially for users with cognitive or
  visual impairments. Our website uses clear and concise headings, making it easier for users to navigate and find the information they need
  quickly.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Overall, we believe that everyone should be able to access the content on our website, and we are committed to continuously improving and
  testing our accessibility features so users can be satisfied with their experience. If you encounter any accessibility issues while
  browsing our website, please do not hesitate to contact us, and we will do our best to address them promptly.
